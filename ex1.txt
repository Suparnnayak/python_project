The dragon sailed across the sky, its wings casting enormous shadows on the emerald forest below.
Meanwhile, a small group of adventurers sat in a dusty tavern, sipping their mead and discussing rumors of hidden treasures deep in the mountains.

where magic and mystery wove through the very fabric of existence like threads in a forgotten tapestry.
